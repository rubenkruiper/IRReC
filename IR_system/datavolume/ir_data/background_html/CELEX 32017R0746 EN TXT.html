   <p class="normal">3.   In the context of the evaluation referred to in paragraph 2, the competent authority shall evaluate the risks arising from the reported serious incident and evaluate any field safety corrective actions, taking into account the protection of public health and criteria such as causality, detectability and probability of recurrence of the problem, frequency of use of the device, probability of occurrence of direct or indirect harm, the severity of that harm, the clinical benefit of the device, intended and potential users, and the population affected. The competent authority shall also evaluate the adequacy of the field safety corrective action envisaged or undertaken by the manufacturer and the need for, and kind of, any other corrective action, in particular taking into account the principle of inherent safety contained in Annex I.</p>
   <p class="normal">Upon request by the national competent authority, manufacturers shall provide for all documents necessary for the risk assessment.</p>

   <p class="normal">5.   The manufacturer shall provide a final report to the competent authority setting out its findings from the investigation by means of the electronic system referred to in Article 87. The report shall set out conclusions and where relevant indicate corrective actions to be taken.</p>
   <p class="normal">6.   In the case of companion diagnostic, the evaluating competent authority or the coordinating competent authority referred to in paragraph 9 of this Article shall, depending on whether the relevant competent authority of the Member State that authorised the medicinal products or the EMA was consulted by the notified body in accordance with the procedures set out in Section 5.2 of Annex IX and Section 3.11 of Annex X, inform that national competent authority or the EMA, as appropriate.</p>
   <p class="normal">7.   After carrying out the evaluation in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article, the evaluating competent authority shall, through the electronic system referred to in Article 87, inform without delay the other competent authorities of the corrective action taken or envisaged by the manufacturer or required of it to minimise the risk of recurrence of the serious incident, including information on the underlying serious incidents and the outcome of its assessment.</p>
   <p class="normal">8.   The manufacturer shall ensure that information about the field safety corrective action taken is brought without delay to the attention of users of the device in question by means of a field safety notice. The field safety notice shall be edited in an official Union language or languages determined by the Member State in which the field safety corrective action is taken. Except in cases of urgency, the content of the draft field safety notice shall be submitted to the evaluating competent authority or, in the cases referred to in paragraph 9, to the coordinating competent authority to allow them to make comments. Unless duly justified by the situation of the individual Member State, the content of the field safety notice shall be consistent in all Member States.</p>
   <p class="normal">The field safety notice shall allow the correct identification of the device or devices involved, in particular by including the relevant UDIs, and the correct identification, in particular by including the SRN, if already issued, of the manufacturer that has undertaken the field safety corrective action. The field safety notice shall explain, in a clear manner, without understating the level of risk, the reasons for the field safety corrective action with reference to the device malfunction and associated risks for patients, users or other persons and shall clearly indicate all the actions to be taken by users.</p>
   <p class="normal">The manufacturer shall enter the field safety notice in the electronic system referred to in Article 87 through which that notice shall be accessible to the public.</p>

      <p id="d1e375-280-1" class="ti-grseq-1">Automatic identification and data capture (‘AIDC’)</p>
      <p class="normal">AIDC is a technology used to automatically capture data. AIDC technologies include bar codes, smart cards, biometrics and RFID.</p>
      <p id="d1e386-280-1" class="ti-grseq-1">Basic UDI-DI</p>
      <p class="normal">The Basic UDI-DI is the primary identifier of a device model. It is the DI assigned at the level of the device unit of use. It is the main key for records in the UDI database and is referenced in relevant certificates and EU declarations of conformity.</p>
      <p id="d1e393-280-1" class="ti-grseq-1">Unit of Use DI</p>
      <p class="normal">The Unit of Use DI serves to associate the use of a device with a patient in instances in which a UDI is not labelled on the individual device at the level of its unit of use, for example in the event of several units of the same device being packaged together.</p>
      <p id="d1e400-280-1" class="ti-grseq-1">Configurable device</p>
      <p class="normal">A configurable device is a device that consists of several components which can be assembled by the manufacturer in multiple configurations. Those individual components may be devices in themselves.</p>
      <p id="d1e407-280-1" class="ti-grseq-1">Configuration</p>
      <p class="normal">Configuration is a combination of items of equipment, as specified by the manufacturer, that operate together as a device to achieve an intended purpose. The combination of items may be modified, adjusted or customised to meet specific needs.</p>
      <p id="d1e414-280-1" class="ti-grseq-1">UDI-DI</p>
      <p class="normal">The UDI-DI is a unique numeric or alphanumeric code specific to a model of device and that is also used as the ‘access key’ to information stored in a UDI database.</p>
      <p id="d1e425-280-1" class="ti-grseq-1">Human Readable Interpretation (HRI)</p>
      <p class="normal">HRI is a legible interpretation of the data characters encoded in the UDI carrier.</p>
      <p id="d1e432-280-1" class="ti-grseq-1">Packaging levels</p>
      <p class="normal">Packaging levels means the various levels of device packaging that contain a fixed quantity of devices, such as a carton or case.</p>
      <p id="d1e439-280-1" class="ti-grseq-1">Production Identifier (UDI-PI)</p>
      <p class="normal">The UDI-PI is a numeric or alphanumeric code that identifies the unit of device production.</p>
      <p class="normal">The different types of UDI-PI(s) include serial number, lot number, software identification and manufacturing or expiry date or both types of date.</p>
      <p id="d1e448-280-1" class="ti-grseq-1">Radio Frequency Identification (‘RFID’)</p>
      <p class="normal">RFID is a technology that uses communication through the use of radio waves to exchange data between a reader and an electronic tag attached to an object, for the purpose of identification.</p>
      <p id="d1e460-280-1" class="ti-grseq-1">Shipping containers</p>
      <p class="normal">A shipping container is a container in relation to which traceability is controlled by a process specific to logistics systems.</p>
      <p id="d1e467-280-1" class="ti-grseq-1">Unique Device Identifier (‘UDI’)</p>
      <p class="normal">The UDI is a series of numeric or alphanumeric characters that is created through a globally accepted device identification and coding standard. It allows the unambiguous identification of a specific device on the market. The UDI is comprised of the UDI-DI and the UDI-PI.</p>
      <p class="normal">The word ‘Unique’ does not imply serialisation of individual production units.</p>
      <p id="d1e484-280-1" class="ti-grseq-1">UDI carrier</p>
      <p class="normal">The UDI carrier is the means of conveying the UDI by using AIDC and, if applicable, its HRI.</p>
      <p class="normal">UDI carriers include, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, ID/linear bar code, 2D/Matrix bar code, RFID.</p>

      <p class="normal">2.1.   The affixing of the UDI is an additional requirement — it does not replace any other marking or labelling requirements laid down in Annex I to this Regulation.</p>
      <p class="normal">2.2.   The manufacturer shall assign and maintain unique UDIs for its devices.</p>
      <p class="normal">2.3.   Only the manufacturer may place the UDI on the device or its packaging.</p>
      <p class="normal">2.4.   Only coding standards provided by issuing entities designated by the Commission pursuant to Article 24(2) may be used.</p>
      <p class="ti-grseq-1" id="d1e524-280-1">3.   The UDI</p>
      <p class="normal">3.1.   A UDI shall be assigned to the device itself or its packaging. Higher levels of packaging shall have their own UDI.</p>
      <p class="normal">3.2.   Shipping containers shall be exempted from the requirement in Section 3.1. By way of example, a UDI shall not be required on a logistics unit; where a healthcare provider orders multiple devices using the UDI or model number of individual devices and the manufacturer places those devices in a container for shipping or to protect the individually packaged devices, the container (logistics unit) shall not be subject to UDI requirements.</p>
      <p class="normal">3.3.   The UDI shall contain two parts: a UDI-DI and a UDI-PI.</p>
      <p class="normal">3.4.   The UDI-DI shall be unique at each level of device packaging.</p>
      <p class="normal">3.5.   If a lot number, serial number, software identification or expiry date appears on the label, it shall be part of the UDI-PI. If there is also a manufacturing date on the label, it does not need to be included in the UDI-PI. If there is only a manufacturing date on the label, this shall be used as the UDI-PI.</p>
      <p class="normal">3.6.   Each component that is considered to be a device and is commercially available on its own shall be assigned a separate UDI unless the components are part of a configurable device that is marked with its own UDI.</p>
      <p class="normal">3.7.   Kits shall be assigned and bear their own UDI.</p>
      <p class="normal">3.8.   The manufacturer shall assign the UDI to a device following the relevant coding standard.</p>
      <p class="normal">3.9.   A new UDI-DI shall be required whenever there is a change that could lead to misidentification of the device and/or ambiguity in its traceability. In particular, any change of one of the following UDI database data elements shall require a new UDI-DI:</p>
