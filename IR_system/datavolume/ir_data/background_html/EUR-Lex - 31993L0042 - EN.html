<p>COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 93/42/EEC of 14 June 1993 concerning medical devices</p><p>THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, </p><p> Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof, </p><p> Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), </p><p> In cooperation with the European Parliament (2), </p><p> Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), </p><p> Whereas measures should be adopted in the context of the internal market; whereas the internal market is an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured; </p><p> Whereas the content and scope of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions in force in the Member States with regard to the safety, health protection and performance characteristics of medical devices are different; whereas the certification  and inspection procedures for such devices differ from one Member State to another; whereas such disparities constitute barriers to trade within the Community; </p><p> Whereas the national provisions for the safety and health protection of patients, users and, where appropriate, other persons, with regard to the use of medical devices should be harmonized in order to guarantee the free movement of such devices within  the internal market; </p><p> Whereas the harmonized provisions must be distinguished from the measures adopted by the Member States to manage the funding of public health and sickness insurance schemes relating directly or indirectly to such devices; whereas, therefore, the  provisions do not affect the ability of the Member States to implement the abovementioned measures provided Community law is complied with; </p><p> Whereas medical devices should provide patients, users and third parties with a high level of protection and attain the performance levels attributed to them by the manufacturer; whereas, therefore, the maintenance or improvement of the level of  protection attained in the Member States is one of the essential objectives of this Directive; </p><p> Whereas certain medical devices are intended to administer medicinal products within the meaning of Council Directive 65/65/EEC of 26 January 1965 on the approximation of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action relating to  proprietary medicinal products (4); whereas, in such cases, the placing on the market of the medical device as a general rule is governed by the present Directive and the placing on the market of the medicinal product is governed by Directive 65/65/EEC;  whereas if, however, such a device is placed on the market in such a way that the device and the medicinal product form a single integral unit which is intended exclusively for use in the given combination and which is not reusable, that single-unit  product shall be governed by Directive 65/65/EEC; whereas a distinction must be drawn between the abovementioned devices and medical devices incorporating, inter alia, substances which, if used separately, may be considered to be a medicinal substance  within the meaning of Directive 65/65/EEC; whereas in such cases, if the substances incorporated in the medical devices are liable to act upon the body with action ancillary to that of the device, the placing of the devices on the market is governed by  this Directive; whereas, in this context, the safety, quality and usefulness of the substances must be verified by analogy with the appropriate methods specified in Council Directive 75/318/EEC of 20 May 1975 on the approximation of the laws of the  Member States relating to analytical, pharmaco-toxicological and clinical standards and protocols in respect of the testing of proprietary medicinal products (5); </p><p> Whereas the essential requirements and other requirements set out in the Annexes to this Directive, including any reference to &#039;minimizing&#039; or &#039;reducing&#039; risk must be interpreted and applied in such a way as to take account of technology and practice  existing at the time of design and of technical and economical considerations compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety; </p><p> Whereas, in accordance with the principles set out in the Council resolution of 7 May 1985 concerning a new approach to technical harmonization and standardization (6), rules regarding the design and manufacture of medical devices must be confined to  the provisions required to meet the essential requirements; whereas, because they are essential, such requirements should replace the corresponding national provisions; whereas the essential requirements should be applied with discretion to take account  of the technological level existing at the time of design and of technical and economic considerations compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety; </p><p> Whereas Council Directive 90/385/EEC of 20 June 1990 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to active implantable medical devices (7) is the first case of application of the new approach to the field of medical devices; whereas  in the interest of uniform Community rules applicable to all medical devices, this Directive is based largely on the provisions of Directive 90/385/EEC; whereas for the same reasons Directive 90/385/EEC must be amended to insert the general provisions  laid down in this Directive; </p><p> Whereas the electromagnetic compatibility aspects form an integral part of the safety of medical devices; whereas this Directive should contain specific rules on this subject with regard to Council Directive 89/336/EEC of 3 May 1989 on the approximation  of the laws of the Member States relating to electromagnetic compatibility (8); </p><p> Whereas this Directive should include requirements regarding the design and manufacture of devices emitting ionizing radiation; whereas this Directive does not affect the authorization required by Council Directive 80/836/Euratom of 15 July 1980  amending the Directives laying down the basic safety standards for the health protection of the general public and workers against the dangers of ionizing radiation (9), nor application of Council Directive 84/466/Euratom of 3 September 1984 laying down  basic measures for the radiation protection of persons undergoing medical examination or treatment (10); whereas Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers  at work (11) and the specific directives on the same subject should continue to apply; </p><p> Whereas, in order to demonstrate conformity with the essential requirements and to enable conformity to be verified, it is desirable to have harmonized European standards to protect against the risks associated with the design, manufacture and packaging  of medical devices; whereas such harmonized European standards are drawn up by private-law bodies and should retain their status as non-mandatory texts; whereas, to this end, the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) and the European Committee  for Electrotechnical Standardization (Cenelec) are recognized as the competent bodies for the adoption of harmonized standards in accordance with the general guidelines on cooperation between the Commission and these two bodies signed on 13 November  1984; </p><p> Whereas, for the purpose of this Directive, a harmonized standard is a technical specification (European standard or harmonization document) adopted, on a mandate from the Commission, by either or both of these bodies in accordance with Council  Directive 83/189/EEC of 28 March 1983 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations (12), and pursuant to the abovementioned general guidelines; whereas with regard to possible amendment of  the harmonized standards, the Commission should be assisted by the Committee set up pursuant to Directive 83/189/EEC; whereas the measures to be taken must be defined in line with procedure I, as laid down in Council Decision 87/373/EEC (13); whereas,  for specific fields, what already exists in the form of European Pharmacopoeia monographs should be incorporated within the framework of this Directive; whereas, therefore, several European Pharmacopoeia monographs may be considered equal to the  abovementioned harmonized standards; </p><p> Whereas, in Decision 90/683/EEC of 13 December 1990 concerning the modules for the various phases of the conformity assessment procedures which are intended to be used in the technical harmonization directives (14), the Council has laid down harmonized  conformity assessment procedures; whereas the application of these modules to medical devices enables the responsibility of manufacturers and notified bodies to be determined during conformity assessment procedures on the basis of the type of devices  concerned; whereas the details added to these modules are justified by the nature of the verification required for medical devices; </p><p> Whereas it is necessary, essentially for the purpose of the conformity assessment procedures, to group the devices into four product classes; whereas the classification rules are based on the vulnerability of the human body taking account of the  potential risks associated with the technical design and manufacture of the devices; whereas the conformity assessment procedures for Class I devices can be carried out, as a general rule, under the sole responsibility of the manufacturers in view of  the low level of vulnerability associated with these products; whereas, for Class IIa devices, the intervention of a notified body should be compulsory at the production stage; whereas, for devices falling within Classes IIb and III which constitute a  high risk potential, inspection by a notified body is required with regard to the design and manufacture of the devices; whereas Class III is set aside for the most critical devices for which explicit prior authorization with regard to conformity is  required for them to be placed on the market; </p><p> Whereas in cases where the conformity of the devices can be assessed under the responsibility of the manufacturer the competent authorities must be able, particularly in emergencies, to contact a person responsible for placing the device on the market  and established in the Community, whether the manufacturer or another person established in the Community and designated by the manufacturer for the purpose; </p><p> Whereas medical devices should, as a general rule, bear the CE mark to indicate their conformity with the provisions of this Directive to enable them to move freely within the Community and to be put into service in accordance with their intended  purpose; </p><p> Whereas, in the fight against AIDS and in the light of the conclusions of the Council adopted on 16 May 1989 regarding future activities on AIDS prevention and control at Community level (15), medical devices used for protection against the HIV virus  must afford a high level of protection; whereas the design and manufacture of such products should be verified by a notified body; </p><p> Whereas the classification rules generally enable medical devices to be appropriately classified; whereas, in view of the diverse nature of the devices and technological progress in this field, steps must be taken to include amongst the implementing  powers conferred on the Commission the decisions to be taken with regard to the proper classification or reclassification of the devices or, where appropriate, the adjustment of the classification rules themselves; whereas since these issues are closely  connected with the protection of health, it is appropriate that these decisions should come under procedure IIIa, as provided for in Directive 87/373/EEC; </p><p> Whereas the confirmation of complicance with the essential requirements may mean that clinical investigations have to be carried out under the responsibility of the manufacturer; whereas, for the purpose of carrying out the clinical investigations,  appropriate means have to be specified for the protection of public health and public order; </p><p> Whereas the protection of health and the associated controls may be made more effective by means of medical device vigilance systems which are integrated at Community level; </p><p> Whereas this Directive covers the medical devices referred to in Council Directive 76/764/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States on clinical mercury-in-glass, maximum reading thermometers (16); whereas the  abovementioned Directive must therefore be repealed; whereas for the same reasons Council Directive 84/539/EEC on 17 September 1984 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to electro-medical equipment used in human or veterinary  medicine (17) must be amended, </p><p> HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: </p><p> </p><p>Article 1 </p><p> Definitions, scope</p><p> 1. This Directive shall apply to medical devices and their accessories. For the purposes of this Directive, accessories shall be treated as medical devices in their own right. Both medical devices and accessories shall hereinafter be termed devices. </p><p> 2. For the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions shall apply: </p><p> (a) &#039;medical device&#039; means any instrument, apparatus, appliance, material or other article, whether used alone or in combination, including the software necessary for its proper application intended by the manufacturer to be used for human beings for  the purpose of: </p><p> - diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of disease, </p><p> - diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of or compensation for an injury or handicap, </p><p> - investigation, replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological process, </p><p> - control of conception, </p><p> and which does not achieve its principal intended action in or on the human body by pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means, but which may be assisted in its function by such means; </p><p> (b) &#039;accessory&#039; means an article which whilst not being a device is intended specifically by its manufacturer to be used together with a device to enable it to be used in accordance with the use of the device intended by the manufacturer of the device;  </p><p> (c) &#039;device used for in vitro diagnosis&#039; means any device which is a reagent, reagent product, kit, instrument, equipment or system, whether used alone or in combination, intended by the manufacturer to be used in vitro for the examination of samples  derived from the human body with a view to providing information on the physiological state, state of health or disease, or congenital abnormality thereof; </p><p> (d) &#039;custom-made device&#039; means any device specifically made in accordance with a duly qualified medical practitioner&#039;s written prescription which gives, under his responsibility, specific design characteristics and is intended for the sole use of a  particular patient. </p><p> The abovementioned prescription may also be made out by any other person authorized by virtue of his professional qualifications to do so. </p><p> Mass-produced devices which need to be adapted to meet the specific requirements of the medical practitioner or any other professional user are not considered to be custom-made devices; </p><p> (e) &#039;device intended for clinical investigation&#039; means any device intended for use by a duly qualified medical practitioner when conducting investigations as referred to in Section 2.1 of Annex X in an adequate human clinical environment. </p><p> For the purpose of conducting clinical investigation, any other person who, by virtue of his professional qualifications, is authorized to carry out such investigation shall be accepted as equivalent to a duly qualified medical practitioner; </p><p> (f) &#039;manufacturer&#039; means the natural or legal person with responsibility for the design, manufacture, packaging and labelling of a device before it is placed on the market under his own name, regardless of whether these operations are carried out by  that person himself or on his behalf by a third party. </p><p> The obligations of this Directive to be met by manufacturers also apply to the natural or legal person who assembles, packages, processes, fully refurbishes and/or labels one or more ready-made products and/or assigns to them their intended purpose as a  device with a view to their being placed on the market under his own name. This subparagraph does not apply to the person who, while not a manufacturer within the meaning of the first subparagraph, assembles or adapts devices already on the market to  their intended purpose for an individual patient; </p><p> (g) &#039;intended purpose&#039; means the use for which the device is intended according to the data supplied by the manufacturer on the labelling, in the instructions and/or in promotional materials; </p><p> (h) &#039;placing on the market&#039; means the first making available in return for payment or free of charge of a device other than a device intended for clinical investigation, with a view to distribution and/or use on the Community market, regardless of  whether it is new or fully refurbished; </p><p> (i) &#039;putting into service&#039; means the stage at which a device is ready for use on the Community market for the first time for its intended purpose. </p><p> 3. Where a device is intended to administer a medicinal product within the meaning of Article 1 of Directive 65/65/EEC, that device shall be governed by the present Directive, without prejudice to the provisions of Directive 65/65/EEC with regard to the  medicinal product. </p><p> If, however, such a device is placed on the market in such a way that the device and the medicinal product form a single integral product which is intended exclusively for use in the given combination and which is not reusable, that single product shall  be governed by Directive 65/65/EEC. The relevant essential requirements of Annex I to the present Directive shall apply as far as safety and performance related device features are concerned. </p><p> 4. Where a device incorporates, as an integral part, a substance which, if used separately, may be considered to be a medicinal product within the meaning of Article 1 of Directive 65/65/EEC and which is liable to act upon the body with action ancillary  to that of the device, that device must be assessed and authorized in accordance with this Directive. </p><p> 5. This Directive does not apply to: </p><p> (a) in vitro diagnostic devices; </p><p> (b) active implantable devices covered by Directive 90/385/EEC; </p><p> (c) medicinal products covered by Directive 65/65/EEC; </p><p> (d) cosmetic products covered by Directive 76/768/EEC (18); </p><p> (e) human blood, human blood products, human plasma or blood cells of human origin or to devices which incorporate at the time of placing on the market such blood products, plasma or cells; </p><p> (f) transplants or tissues or cells of human origin nor to products incorporating or derived from tissues or cells of human origin; </p><p> (g) transplants or tissues or cells of animal origin, unless a device is manufactured utilizing animal tissue which is rendered non-viable or non-viable products derived from animal tissue. </p><p> 6. This Directive does not apply to personal protective equipment covered by Directive 89/686/EEC. In deciding whether a product falls under that Directive or the present Directive, particular account shall be taken of the principal intended purpose of  the product. </p><p> 7. This Directive is a specific Directive within the meaning of Article 2 (2) of Directive 89/336/EEC. </p><p> 8. This Directive does not affect the application of Directive 80/836/Euratom, nor of Directive 84/466/Euratom. </p><p> </p><p>Article 2 </p><p> Placing on the market and putting into service</p><p> Member States shall take all necessary steps to ensure that devices may be placed on the market and put into service only if they do not compromise the safety and health of patients, users and, where applicable, other persons when properly installed,  maintained and used in accordance with their intended purpose. </p><p> </p><p>Article 3 </p><p> Essential requirements</p><p> The devices must meet the essential requirements set out in Annex I which apply to them, taking account of the intended purpose of the devices concerned. </p><p> </p><p>Article 4 </p><p> Free movement, devices intended for special purposes</p><p> 1. Member States shall not create any obstacle to the placing on the market or the putting into service within their territory of devices bearing the CE marking provided for in Article 17 which indicate that they have been the subject of an assessment  of their conformity in accordance with the provisions of Article 11. </p><p> 2. Member States shall not create any obstacle to: </p><p> - devices intended for clinical investigation being made available to medical practitioners or authorized persons for that purpose if they meet the conditions laid down in Article 15 and in Annex VIII, </p><p> - custom-made devices being placed on the market and put into service if they meet the conditions laid down in Article 11 in combination with Annex VIII; Class IIa, IIb and III devices shall be accompanied by the statement referred to in Annex VIII. </p><p> These devices shall not bear the CE marking. </p><p> 3. At trade fairs, exhibitions, demonstrations, etc. Member States shall not create any obstacle to the showing of devices which do not conform to this Directive, provided that a visible sign clearly indicates that such devices cannot be marketed or put  into service until they have been made to comply. </p><p> 4. Member States may require the information, which must be made available to the user and the patient in accordance with Annex I, point 13, to be in their national language(s) or in another Community language, when a device reaches the final user,  regardless of whether it is for professional or other use. </p><p> 5. Where the devices are subject to other Directives concerning other aspects and which also provide for the affixing of the CE marking, the latter shall indicate that the devices also fulfil the provisions of the other Directives. </p><p> However, should one or more of these directives allow the manufacturer, during a transitional period, to choose which arrangements to apply, the CE marking shall indicate that the devices fulfil the provisions only of those directives applied by the  manufacturer. In this case, the particulars of these directives, as published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, must be given in the documents, notices or instructions required by the directives and accompanying such devices. </p><p> </p><p>Article 5 </p><p> Reference to standards</p><p> 1. Member States shall presume compliance with the essential requirements referred to in Article 3 in respect of devices which are in conformity with the relevant national standards adopted pursuant to the harmonized standards the references of which  have been publishes in the Official Journal of the European Communities; Member States shall publish the references of such national standards. </p><p> 2. For the purposes of this Directive, reference to harmonized standards also includes the monographs of the European Pharmacopoeia notably on surgical sutures and on interaction between medicinal products and materials used in devices containing such  medicinal products, the references of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Communities. </p><p> 3. If a Member State or the Commission considers that the harmonized standards do not entirely meet the essential requirements referred to in Article 3, the measures to be taken by the Member States with regard to these standards and the publication  referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be adopted by the procedure defined in Article 6 (2). </p><p> </p><p>Article 6 </p><p> Committee on Standards and Technical Regulations</p><p> 1. The Commission shall be assisted by the Committee set up by Article 5 of Directive 83/189/EEC. </p><p> 2. The representative of the Commission shall submit to the Committee a draft of the measures to be taken. The Committee shall deliver its opinion on the draft within a time limit which the chairman may lay down according to the urgency of the matter,  if necessary by taking a vote. </p><p> The opinion shall be recorded in the minutes; in addition, each Member State shall have the right to ask to have its position recorded in the minutes. </p><p> The Commission shall take the utmost account of the opinion delivered by the Committee. It shall inform the Committee of the manner in which its opinion has been taken into account. </p><p> </p><p>Article 7 </p><p> Committee on Medical Devices</p><p> 1. The Commission shall be assisted by the Committee set up by Article 6 (2) of Directive 90/385/EEC. </p><p> 2. The representative of the Commission shall submit to the Committee a draft of the measures to be taken. The Committee shall deliver its opinion on the draft within a time limit which the chairman may lay down according to the urgency of the matter.  The opinion shall be delivered by the majority laid down in Article 148 (2) of the Treaty in the case of decisions which the Council is required to adopt on a proposal from the Commission. The votes of the representatives of the Member States within the  Committee shall be weighted in the manner set out in that Article. The chairman shall not vote. </p><p> The Commission shall adopt the measures envisaged if they are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee. </p><p> If the measures envisaged are not in accordance with the opinion of the Committee, or if no opinion is delivered, the Commission shall, without delay, submit to the Council a proposal relating to the measures to be taken. The Council shall act by a  qualified majority. </p><p> If, on the expiry of a period of three months from the date of referral to the Council, the Council has not acted, the proposed measures shall be adopted by the Commission. </p><p> 4. The Committee may examine any question connected with implementation of this Directive. </p><p> </p><p>Article 8 </p><p> Safeguard clause</p><p> 1. Where a Member State ascertains that the devices referred to in Article 4 (1) and (2) second indent, when correctly installed, maintained and used for their intended purpose, may compromise the health and/or safety of patients, users or, where  applicable, other persons, it shall take all appropriate interim measures to withdraw such devices from the market or prohibit or restrict their being placed on the market or put into service. The Member State shall immediately inform the Commission of  any such measures, indicating the reasons for its decision and, in particular, whether non-compliance with this Directive is due to: </p><p> (a) failure to meet the essential requirements referred to in Article 3; </p><p> (b) incorrect application of the standards referred to in Article 5, in so far as it is claimed that the standards have been applied; </p><p> (c) shortcomings in the standards themselves. </p><p> 2. The Commission shall enter into consultation with the parties concerned as soon as possible. Where, after such consultation, the Commission finds that: </p><p> - the measures are justified, it shall immediately so inform the Member State which took the initiative and the other Member States; where the decision referred to in paragraph 1 is attributed to shortcomings in the standards, the Commission shall,  after consulting the parties concerned, bring the matter before the Committee referred to in Article 6 (1) within two months if the Member State which has taken the decision intends to maintain it and shall initiate the procedures referred to in Article  6, </p><p> - the measures are unjustified, it shall immediately so inform the Member State which took the initiative and the manufacturer or his authorized representative established within the Community. </p><p> 3. Where a non-complying device bears the CE marking, the competent Member State shall take appropriate action against whomsoever has affixed the mark and shall inform the Commission and the other Member States thereof. </p><p> 4. The Commission shall ensure that the Member States are kept informed of the progress and outcome of this procedure. </p><p> </p><p>Article 9 </p><p> Classification</p><p> 1. Devices shall be divided into Classes I, IIa, IIb and III. Classification shall be carried out in accordance with Annex IX. </p><p> 2. In the event of a dispute between the manufacturer and the notified body concerned, resulting from the application of the classification rules, the matter shall be referred for decision to the competent authority to which the notified body is  subject. </p><p> 3. The classification rules set out in Annex IX may be adapted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 7 (2) in the light of technical progress and any information which becomes available under the information system provided for in  </p><p>Article 10. </p><p> </p><p>Article 10 </p><p> Information on incidents occuring following placing of devices on the market</p><p> 1. Member States shall take the necessary steps to ensure that any information brought to their knowledge, in accordance with the provisions of this Directive, regarding the incidents mentioned below involving a Class I, IIa, IIb or III device is  recorded and evaluated centrally: </p><p> (a) any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well as any inadequacy in the labelling or the instructions for use which might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient or user or to a serious  deterioration in his state of health; </p><p> (b) any technical or medical reason in relation to the characteristics or performance of a device for the reasons referred to in subparagraph (a), leading to systematic recall of devices of the same type by the manufacturer. </p><p> 2. Where a Member State requires medical practitioners or the medical institutions to inform the competent authorities of any incidents referred to in paragraph 1, it shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the manufacturer of the device  concerned, or his authorized representative established in the Community, is also informed of the incident. </p><p> 3. After carrying out an assessment, if possible together with the manufacturer, Member States shall, without prejudice to Article 8, immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States of the incidents referred to in paragraph 1 for which  relevant measures have been taken or are contemplated. </p><p> </p><p>Article 11 </p><p> Conformity assessment procedures</p><p> 1. In the case of devices falling within Class III, other than devices which are custom-made or intended for clinical investigations, the manufacturer shall, in order to affix the CE marking, either: </p><p> (a) follow the procedure relating to the EC declaration of conformity set out in Annex II (full quality assurance); or</p><p> (b) follow the procedure relating to the EC type-examination set out in Annex III, coupled with: </p><p> (i) the procedure relating to the EC verification set out in Annex IV; </p><p> or</p><p> (ii) the procedure relating to the EC declaration of conformity set out in Annex V (production quality assurance). </p><p> 2.
